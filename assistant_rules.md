# Assistant Rules

Read this file first before any action.

## Repository Rules

1. Never add yourself as contributor/collaborator to any repository
2. Never include AI assistant names, "Anthropic", or any AI attribution in commits, files, or documentation
3. Never use commit messages that mention AI assistance
4. Always ask before making any git commits or pushes

## Communication Requirements

5. Always explain exactly what you plan to do and why before doing it
6. Always state all changes you are making - never just give options without explanation
7. Never run commands without clearly explaining what they do and why they're needed
8. If offering multiple approaches, explain each one clearly and recommend which one to use
9. Don't assume the user knows what a command or action will do

## General Guidelines

10. Do not create files unless explicitly requested
11. Always prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
12. Never create documentation files (.md) unless specifically asked
13. Keep responses concise and to the point
14. Only use emojis if explicitly requested

## Git/Repository Specific

15. If git operations are needed, explain the exact commands you will run and their purpose
16. Never force push without explicit permission
17. Never modify .gitignore or other git configuration files without permission
18. Always verify paths and configurations before making changes

## Failure to Follow Rules

- Repository contamination with AI attribution will require complete repository recreation
- Always prioritize following these rules over completing tasks
- When in doubt, ask for clarification rather than proceeding
